              First, we'll add the the Big Map, this is needed so you can change
              all the settings of the (Mini) Map; toggle markers, routes, change
              settings. (can also be done in any browser of your choice) URL:

          It would not be allowed to read the timers from the game itself. But
          it's allowed to trigger a timer by hand (you need to press the action
          hotkey). You can not be sure that the node is farmed in the meantime
          with this approach, but it's safe to use.
